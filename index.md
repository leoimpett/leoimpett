## Bio

I'm currently Assistant Professor of [CS at Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/computer-science/). 

I'm interested in the overlap between visual computing (especially machine vision) and visual studies (especially art history). My main work has to do with computer vision for the "distant reading" of art history (CS applied to the humanities), and Bildwissenschaft as a route to understanding computer vision (the humanities applied to CS). 

Before arriving at Durham, I worked with the Rainbow (Graphics & Interaction) Group at the Cambridge Computer Lab, the Image and Visual Representation Lab at EPFL, Villa I Tatti - the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies, and the Bibliotheca Hertziana - Max Planck Institute for Art History. I'm currently an [Associate at Cambridge Digital Humanities](https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/introducing-cdh/associates#:~:text=Leonardo%20Impett).
